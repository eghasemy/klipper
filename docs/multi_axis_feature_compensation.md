# Multi-Axis Support and G-code Feature Type Compensation

This document describes the enhanced multi-axis support and G-code feature type compensation system implemented for advanced resonance compensation.

## Overview

The system has been enhanced with two major new capabilities:

1. **Multi-Axis Support**: Extended from 2-axis (X,Y) to full 6-axis support (X,Y,Z,A,B,C)
2. **G-code Feature Type Detection**: Automatic detection and compensation based on slicer feature comments

## Multi-Axis Support

### Supported Axes

The system now supports up to 6 axes:
- **X, Y**: Primary horizontal movement axes
- **Z**: Vertical movement axis  
- **A, B, C**: Rotational axes for multi-head printers and advanced kinematics

### Implementation

All analysis and compensation algorithms have been extended to handle multi-axis motion:

```python
# Motion analysis now supports 6-axis data
position = [x, y, z, a, b, c]        # Position for all axes
velocity = [vx, vy, vz, va, vb, vc]  # Velocity for all axes
acceleration = [ax, ay, az, aa, ab, ac]  # Acceleration for all axes

recommendations = analyzer.analyze_motion(position, velocity, acceleration, timestamp)
# Returns recommendations for all active axes
```

### Backward Compatibility

The system maintains full backward compatibility:
- 2-axis systems (X,Y only) continue to work unchanged
- 3-axis systems (X,Y,Z) are automatically detected and supported
- Parameters and configurations for additional axes are optional

## G-code Feature Type Detection

### Supported Feature Types

The system automatically detects these slicer-generated feature types:

- `WALL-OUTER`: External perimeters (default: quality preset)
- `WALL-INNER`: Internal perimeters (default: balance preset)
- `INFILL`: Infill patterns (default: speed preset)
- `SUPPORT`: Support structures (default: speed preset)
- `BRIDGE`: Bridge sections (default: quality preset)
- `TOP-SURFACE`: Top surface layers (default: quality preset)
- `BOTTOM-SURFACE`: Bottom surface layers (default: balance preset)
- `PERIMETER`: General perimeter lines (default: quality preset)
- `SOLID-INFILL`: Solid infill areas (default: balance preset)
- `SPARSE-INFILL`: Sparse infill patterns (default: speed preset)

### Detection Pattern

The system uses regex pattern matching to detect feature type comments:

```
;TYPE:WALL-OUTER
; TYPE:INFILL  
;type:support
```

The pattern is case-insensitive and handles various spacing formats.

### Quality Presets

Three quality presets are available for each feature type:

#### Speed Preset
- **Preferred shapers**: `smooth`, `zv`, `mzv`
- **Frequency adjustment**: ×1.1 (higher frequency for faster movement)
- **Damping adjustment**: ×0.9 (reduced damping for speed)
- **Use case**: Infill, supports, non-visible features

#### Balance Preset  
- **Preferred shapers**: `ei`, `adaptive_ei`, `mzv`
- **Frequency adjustment**: ×1.0 (baseline frequency)
- **Damping adjustment**: ×1.0 (baseline damping)
- **Use case**: Internal walls, bottom surfaces, general features

#### Quality Preset
- **Preferred shapers**: `ulv`, `multi_freq`, `ei`
- **Frequency adjustment**: ×0.95 (lower frequency for stability)
- **Damping adjustment**: ×1.2 (increased damping for quality)
- **Use case**: External walls, bridges, top surfaces, visible features

## Configuration

### Algorithm Extensions

All existing algorithms have been enhanced for multi-axis support:

- **Motion Pattern Detection**: Extended to 6-dimensional motion analysis
- **Resonance Compensation**: Individual axis parameter calculation
- **Spatial Interpolation**: Multi-axis position-dependent adjustments
- **Parameter Transitions**: Smooth changes across all active axes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Feature Types Not Detected**
   - Check G-code contains `;TYPE:` comments
   - Verify slicer settings include feature type comments
   - Use `GET_DYNAMIC_SHAPER_STATUS` to check current feature

2. **Multi-Axis Not Working**
   - Ensure kinematics supports additional axes
   - Check axis configuration in printer.cfg
   - Verify motion data includes all axis positions

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Reduce `adaptation_rate` for slower updates
   - Increase `min_update_interval` for less frequent changes
   - Disable unused axes in configuration

### Debug Commands

```gcode
# Check feature detection
GET_DYNAMIC_SHAPER_STATUS

# Test feature compensation
SET_FEATURE_COMPENSATION FEATURE=TEST PREFERENCE=quality

# Monitor motion analysis
# (Enable debug logging in klippy.log)
```
