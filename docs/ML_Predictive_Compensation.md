# Machine Learning and Predictive Compensation

This document describes the advanced machine learning and predictive compensation features that enhance Klipper's input shaping system with intelligent pattern recognition and lookahead optimization.

## Overview

The ML and predictive compensation system transforms Klipper's input shaping from reactive to proactive, using machine learning to recognize motion patterns and predictive analysis to optimize compensation before resonance issues occur.

### Key Features

- **ML Pattern Recognition**: Automatically classifies motion patterns using machine learning
- **Predictive Lookahead**: Analyzes upcoming G-code commands to predict compensation needs
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Dynamically adjusts compensation parameters during printing
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves accuracy through feedback and automatic retraining
- **Multi-axis Support**: Works with X, Y, Z, A, B, C axes
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors effectiveness and provides optimization feedback

## Machine Learning Pattern Recognition

### How It Works

The ML system extracts motion features from printer data and uses trained models to classify patterns:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Analyzes velocity, acceleration, direction changes, and movement patterns
2. **Pattern Classification**: Uses Random Forest models to identify motion types
3. **Novel Pattern Discovery**: K-means clustering detects new, previously unseen patterns
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for each prediction
5. **Continuous Learning**: Automatically improves with collected data

### Recognized Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Characteristics | Optimal Shaper |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| `perimeter` | Outer/inner walls | Consistent speed, low direction changes | ULV |
| `infill` | Fill patterns | High direction changes, variable speed | Smooth |
| `bridge` | Bridge printing | Linear motion, constant speed | ULV |
| `support` | Support material | Irregular patterns, variable feedrate | Smooth |
| `detailed` | Fine detail work | Low speeds, precise movements | ULV |
| `travel` | Non-printing moves | High speed, straight lines | Smooth |
| `corner_heavy` | Corner-rich geometry | Frequent direction changes | EI |

### Training Data Collection

The system automatically collects training data during printing:

```gcode
; G-code with TYPE comments automatically provides ground truth
;TYPE:WALL-OUTER
G1 X10 Y10 F1500
; System learns: this motion pattern = perimeter
```

## Predictive Compensation

### Lookahead Analysis

The predictive system analyzes upcoming G-code commands to forecast compensation needs:

1. **G-code Buffering**: Maintains buffer of upcoming commands
2. **Sequence Analysis**: Identifies coherent motion sequences
3. **Pattern Prediction**: Forecasts motion characteristics
4. **Resonance Risk Assessment**: Estimates vibration excitation potential
5. **Compensation Scheduling**: Pre-calculates and schedules parameter changes

### Prediction Pipeline

```
G-code Commands → Sequence Detection → Pattern Classification → Risk Assessment → Compensation Scheduling → Parameter Application
```

### Resonance Risk Factors

- **High Speed**: Feedrates > 3000 mm/min increase risk
- **Direction Changes**: Sharp angle changes (> 30°) 
- **Acceleration**: High acceleration values
- **Repetitive Motion**: Resonance-exciting frequencies

### Fallback Behavior

If scikit-learn is not available:
- System automatically disables ML features
- Falls back to enhanced rule-based pattern detection
- Predictive compensation continues to work
- No functionality is lost

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ML model not training**
```
Check: Sufficient training samples collected?
Solution: Wait for more data or use TRAIN_ML_MODEL FORCE=1
```

**Poor pattern recognition accuracy**
```
Check: G-code includes TYPE comments?
Solution: Use slicer with feature type comments
```

**High CPU usage**
```
Check: Prediction interval too frequent?
Solution: Increase prediction_interval to 0.5
```

**Memory usage growing**
```
Check: Training data collection enabled?
Solution: Disable collect_training_data after initial training
```
